    This blog post is an example of a blogpost
    which can be added to the documentation.
    Unfortunately, it does not rely on an existing python blog generator
    as it was difficult to entirely change the existing framework
    and to keep track on references.

    It is just a *rst* file which starts with a header like the following::

        .. blogpost::
            :title: An example of a blog post included in the documentation
            :keywords: example, blogpost, documentation
            :date: 2015-04-04
            :categories: documentation, example

    However, you can check some of the following to power your blog:
    `What's the best available static blog/website generator in Python
    <http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-available-static-blog-website-generator-in-Python>`_
    or this page which gathers many framework to build a static website:
    `StaticGen Top Open-Source Static Site Generators <https://www.staticgen.com/>`_.
